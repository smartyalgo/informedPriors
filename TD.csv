This study focused on the antisenescence effect of four plant species (Falcaria vulgaris, Ixiolirion tataricum, Ajuga chamaecistus, and Scabiosa flavida) on H2 O2 -induced premature senescence in rat NIH3T3 fibroblasts, which were found to be rich in effective phytochemicals with traditional ethnobotanical backgrounds. Plant materials were collected, identified, and extracted. To determine the viability of NIH3T3 cells, an MTT assay was conducted. The levels of OS markers and the senescence-associated ß-galactosidase (SA-ß-GAL) activity were analyzed by the Elisa reader. The cell cycle pattern was evaluated by flow cytometry. The expression of senescence-related inflammatory cytokines and the molecules involved in aging signaling pathways were investigated using the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). H2 O2 treatment decreased cell viability and increased lipid peroxidation (LPO) and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in NIH3T3s. However, S. flavida exhibited low cytotoxicity, reduced OS and SA-ß-GAL activities in NIH3T3 cells compared with the H2 O2 -treated group. I. tataricum was the second best plant, although it was more toxic to NIHT3T cells. S. flavida decreased G0/G1 arrest and facilitated the G2/M transition of NIH3T3s, also downregulated the expression of p38, p53, p16, and the related inflammatory mediators. S. flavida potentially modulated senescence-associated hallmarks in fibroblasts exposed to H2 O2 , thus it may inhibit the aging process via controlling the OS. Therefore it is a promising candidate for future antiaging explorations."

In this study, we investigated whether rapamycin could ameliorate age-associated phenotypes in a mouse model of genetically enhanced NF-κB activity (nfκb1-/- ) characterized by low-grade chronic inflammation, accelerated aging and CLD.

Environmental factors are also often implicated in dry eye including exposure to pollutants, ultraviolet (UV) radiation and ozone as well as the chronic use of preserved eyedrops such as in the treatment of glaucoma. These factors increase oxidative stress and ocular surface inflammation. Here, we reviewed the cellular, animal and clinical studies that point to the role of oxidative stress in dry eye disease. The biomarkers used to indicate oxidative damage in ocular surface tissues include 8-hydroxy-2 deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) and malondialdehyde (MDD). Antioxidative defences in the ocular surface occur in the form of tear proteins such as lactoferrin and S100A proteins, and enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase, catalase and mitochondrial oxidative enzymes. An imbalance between the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the action of protective enzymes will lead to oxidative damage, and possibly inflammation. A small number of interventional studies suggest that oxidative stress may be directly targeted in topical therapy of dry eye treatment. For example, in vitro studies suggest that L-carnitine and pterostilbene, a blueberry component may reduce oxidative stress, and in animal studies, alpha-lipoic acid (ALP) and selenoprotein P may be helpful. Examples of treatments used in clinical trials include vitamin B12 eyedrops and iodide iontophoresis. With recent emphasis on ageing medicine and preventive holistic health, as well as the role of environmental science, research on oxidative stress in the ocular surface is likely to have increasing impact in the coming years."

The histological findings corroborated the effective role of PTS in countering STZ induced structural aberrations in brain."

Evidences accrued in empirical studies suggest the antioxidant, anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities of the phytochemical pterostilbene (PTS). PTS also exhibits favourable pharmacokinetic attributes compared to other stilbenes. Hence, in the present study, we explored the neuroprotective role of PTS in ameliorating the intracerebroventricular administered streptozotocin (STZ) induced memory decline in rats. PTS at doses of 10, 30 and 50 mg/kg, was administered orally to STZ administered Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The learning and memory tests, Morris water maze test and novel object recognition test were performed which revealed improved cognition on PTS treatment. Further, there was an overall improvement in brain antioxidant parameters like elevated catalase and superoxide dismutase activities, GSH levels, lowered levels of nitrites, lipid peroxides and carbonylated proteins. There was improved cholinergic transmission as evident by decreased acetylcholinesterase activities. The action of ATPases (Na+ K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+) indicating the maintenance of cell membrane potential was also augmented. mRNA expression of battery of genes involved in cellular mitochondrial biogenesis and inflammation showed variations which extrapolate to hike in mitochondrial biogenesis and abated inflammation.

autophagy,large insoluble protein aggregates,removing,-1,negative,in vitro,cells from aggressive acute lymphoblastic leukemia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26477823,"BACKGROUND: Environmental conditions or chemical agents can interfere with the function of the endoplasmic reticulum, and the resulting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress can be toxic to the cell if it is not relieved. The classical compensatory response to ER stress is the unfolded protein response (UPR) that reduces protein load in the ER. However, autophagy may also compensate by removing large insoluble protein aggregates. Agents that stress the ER can have anti-cancer activity, and novel applications of ER stress inducing agents are being investigated. Plant stilbenes are a class of stress responsive molecules that includes resveratrol, which are being investigated as potential therapeutics in humans for conditions such as aging or cancer. RESULTS: We performed a screen of 1726 small, drug like molecules to identify those that could activate an ER-stress responsive luciferase gene. After secondary screening, we determined that the plant stilbenes pterostilbene and piceatannol were the most potent inducers of ER stress from this group. ER stress can be particularly toxic to cells with high ER load, so we examined their effect on cells expressing the Wnt family of secreted glycoprotein growth factors. Molecular analysis determined that these ER stress-inducing stilbenes could block Wnt processing and also induce autophagy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells expressing Wnt16. Combining pterostilbene (to induce ER stress) with chloroquine (to inhibit autophagy) lead to significant cellular toxicity in cells from aggressive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Plant stilbenes are potent inducers of ER stress. However, their toxicity is more pronounced in cancer cells expressing Wnt growth factors. The toxicity of stilbenes in these ALL cells can be potentiated by the addition of autophagy inhibitors, suggesting a possible therapeutic application."

However, the complex array of phytochemicals in coffee and cacao beans and tea leaves has hindered a clear understanding of the component(s) that affect neuronal plasticity and resilience. One class of phytochemicals present in relatively high amounts in coffee, tea and cacao are methylxanthines. Among such methylxanthines, caffeine has been the most widely studied and has clear effects on neuronal network activity, promotes sustained cognitive performance and can protect neurons against dysfunction and death in animal models of stroke, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Caffeine's mechanism of action relies on antagonism of various subclasses of adenosine receptors. Downstream xanthine metabolites, such as theobromine and theophylline, may also contribute to the beneficial effects of coffee, tea and cacao on brain health."
