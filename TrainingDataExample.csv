S. flavida,aging process,inhibit,-1,positive,,rat NIH3T3 fibroblasts,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30474871,"Aging contributes to an increased risk of developing a number of neurodegenerative and chronic disorders, predominantly related to oxidative stress (OS) and defects in the antioxidant balance. This study focused on the antisenescence effect of four plant species (Falcaria vulgaris, Ixiolirion tataricum, Ajuga chamaecistus, and Scabiosa flavida) on H2 O2 -induced premature senescence in rat NIH3T3 fibroblasts, which were found to be rich in effective phytochemicals with traditional ethnobotanical backgrounds. Plant materials were collected, identified, and extracted. To determine the viability of NIH3T3 cells, an MTT assay was conducted. The levels of OS markers and the senescence-associated ß-galactosidase (SA-ß-GAL) activity were analyzed by the Elisa reader. The cell cycle pattern was evaluated by flow cytometry. The expression of senescence-related inflammatory cytokines and the molecules involved in aging signaling pathways were investigated using the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). H2 O2 treatment decreased cell viability and increased lipid peroxidation (LPO) and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in NIH3T3s. However, S. flavida exhibited low cytotoxicity, reduced OS and SA-ß-GAL activities in NIH3T3 cells compared with the H2 O2 -treated group. I. tataricum was the second best plant, although it was more toxic to NIHT3T cells. S. flavida decreased G0/G1 arrest and facilitated the G2/M transition of NIH3T3s, also downregulated the expression of p38, p53, p16, and the related inflammatory mediators. S. flavida potentially modulated senescence-associated hallmarks in fibroblasts exposed to H2 O2 , thus it may inhibit the aging process via controlling the OS. Therefore it is a promising candidate for future antiaging explorations."

rapamycin,aging phenotypes,delays,-1,positive,fed,mouse model of genetically enhanced NF-κB activity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30468013,"Increased activation of the major pro-inflammatory NF-κB pathway leads to numerous age-related diseases, including chronic liver disease (CLD). Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, extends lifespan and healthspan, potentially via suppression of inflammaging, a process which is partially dependent on NF-κB signalling. However, it is unknown if rapamycin has beneficial effects in the context of compromised NF-κB signalling, such as that which occurs in several age-related chronic diseases. In this study, we investigated whether rapamycin could ameliorate age-associated phenotypes in a mouse model of genetically enhanced NF-κB activity (nfκb1-/- ) characterized by low-grade chronic inflammation, accelerated aging and CLD. We found that, despite showing no beneficial effects in lifespan and inflammaging, rapamycin reduced frailty and improved long-term memory, neuromuscular coordination and tissue architecture. Importantly, markers of cellular senescence, a known driver of age-related pathology, were alleviated in rapamycin-fed animals. Our results indicate that, in conditions of genetically enhanced NF-κB, rapamycin delays aging phenotypes and improves healthspan uncoupled from its role as a suppressor of inflammation."
